# Computer Science 204: Database Programming final project

This is a copy of my final project for my Database Programming course where I detail the steps I take to build tables from scratch using data provided and run through 14 queries to test my knowledge of MySQL.

This was my first time ever working with SQL so it was a fun challenge to build a database from scratch and learn the proper syntax for SQL. I made a few mistakes along the way and notated what I learned from them.
